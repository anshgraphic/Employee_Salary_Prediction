üìä Employee Salary Prediction Model
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting employee salaries based on various demographic and professional attributes. The project includes a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook for data analysis, model training, and evaluation, along with a Streamlit web application for interactive salary prediction.

‚ú® Project Overview
The aim of this project is to develop a robust machine learning model that can accurately predict an individual's salary. This tool can be valuable for HR professionals in setting competitive compensation, and for job seekers to understand their market value. The model considers factors such as age, gender, education level, job title, and years of experience.

üöÄ Features
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handles missing values, duplicate entries, and standardizes categorical features.

High Cardinality Handling: Implements a strategy to manage 'Job Title' categories by grouping less frequent ones into 'Other'.

Outlier Detection & Removal: Uses the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to ensure robust model training.

Feature Scaling & Encoding: Applies StandardScaler for numerical features and OneHotEncoder for categorical features using ColumnTransformer.

Multiple Model Training: Explores various regression algorithms including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.

Model Evaluation: Comprehensive evaluation using metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE, and R-squared.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizes the best-performing model (Random Forest) using GridSearchCV.

Model Persistence: Saves the trained model and preprocessor for easy deployment.

Interactive Web Application: A user-friendly Streamlit app for real-time salary predictions.

Input Validation: Ensures logical consistency between Age and Years of Experience in the web app.

‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup
Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/anshgraphic/Employee_Salary_Prediction.git
cd Employee_Salary_Prediction

Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended):

python -m venv venv
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

Install Dependencies:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn joblib streamlit nltk

üöÄ How to Run the Project
1. Run the Jupyter Notebook
The Untitled.ipynb notebook contains all the steps for data loading, cleaning, preprocessing, EDA, model training, and evaluation.

Launch Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook

Open Untitled.ipynb in your browser.

Run all cells from top to bottom. This will:

Process the data.

Train the machine learning model.

Save model.joblib (the trained Random Forest model) and preprocessor.joblib (the trained ColumnTransformer) in the same directory. These files are essential for the Streamlit app.

2. Run the Streamlit Web Application
Once model.joblib and preprocessor.joblib are generated by the Jupyter Notebook, you can run the Streamlit app.

Ensure you are in the Employee_Salary_Prediction directory in your terminal (where try.py, model.joblib, and preprocessor.joblib are located).

Execute the Streamlit app:

streamlit run try.py

The application will open in your default web browser (usually at http://localhost:8501).

üìà Model Performance
The project's best model, the Tuned Random Forest Regressor, achieved strong performance metrics.

R-squared (R 
2
 ): [Insert your best R-squared value here, e.g., 0.9523]

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): [Insert your best RMSE value here, e.g., ‚Çπ15,000]

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): [Insert your best MAE value here, e.g., ‚Çπ10,000]

(These values should be copied from the output of your Jupyter Notebook's evaluation cell.)

üí° Key Findings & Insights
Years of Experience and Job Title are typically strong predictors of salary.

Effective handling of categorical features and outliers significantly improves model accuracy.

The Random Forest algorithm's ensemble nature allows it to capture complex, non-linear relationships in the data.

The Streamlit app provides an intuitive way to demonstrate the model's capabilities and allows for quick salary estimations based on user inputs.

üîÆ Future Enhancements
Data Enrichment: Incorporate more features like location, company size/type, specific skills, and industry.

Advanced Models: Explore XGBoost, LightGBM, or deep learning approaches for potential accuracy gains.

Model Interpretability: Implement SHAP or LIME to provide explanations for individual salary predictions.

Continuous Integration/Deployment (CI/CD): Set up automated pipelines for model retraining and app deployment.

User Feedback Loop: Add functionality to collect user feedback on predictions to continuously improve the model.
